# Bank-Marketing-Dataset
## Abstract
This project aims to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit using the Bank Marketing dataset. Several machine learning models, including LightGBM, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and Random Forest, were trained and evaluated using the PyCaret library. After hyperparameter tuning, the best-performing model achieved an accuracy of approximately 93%, demonstrating the potential of machine learning in predicting customer behavior in the banking sector.
